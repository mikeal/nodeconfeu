# DONT TELL ANYONE!

**This document contains several pieces of information that we're holding on to as a surprise for the attendees so please don't share the information contained within.**

## Session Format

Sessions are broken in to blocks of 60-80 minutes (3-4 talks at 20 minutes each) similar to NodeConf 2012. The only exceptions are keynotes talks which have varying lengths and times.

**You will not go over 20 minutes,  you will be pulled :)**

Every block is proceeded by a break. Breaks have varying length to deal with other logistical issues. All posted times are subject to change as the day progresses in order to handle logistical issues.

All blocks take place in the beginning of the day and end before 5pm. The evenings include hands-on trainings and hack time.

# Blocks

The ordering of people in this list is **not** the order you will be speaking in. Ordering will be worked out in the issue threads about your block.
